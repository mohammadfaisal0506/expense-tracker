üìà Expense Tracker: Full-Stack Application Documentation
This document provides a detailed overview of the Expense Tracker application, a full-stack project built with a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit frontend. The application allows users to track their expenses, manage a personal budget, and provides administrators with tools for user and category management.

üöÄ Application Stack
Backend: FastAPI with MongoDB for data persistence.

Frontend: Streamlit for the user interface.

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with OAuth2.0 for secure access.

Password Hashing: bcrypt via passlib for secure password storage.

üíª Backend API Documentation (FastAPI)
The backend provides a RESTful API to handle all data operations. All endpoints are protected and require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header, unless explicitly noted.

üñºÔ∏è Frontend Application Documentation (Streamlit)
The Streamlit frontend is a single-page application that interacts with the backend API to provide a dynamic user experience. The interface is adaptive, with the navigation menu and available pages changing based on the user's role.

Core Features
Login & Registration: Separate forms for new user registration and existing user login. The login page also supports an "Admin Login" option for role-specific access.

Session Management: The application uses st.session_state to maintain user login status and store the authentication token and user data, ensuring a persistent session across interactions.

User Interface (User Role)
Authenticated users are presented with a sidebar menu to navigate through their personal expense tracker.

Manage Budget: Displays the user's current balance and allows them to add funds to their account.

Add Expense: A form to log new expenses. A check is performed on the frontend to ensure the user has sufficient funds before submitting the request.

View Expenses: A dynamic table of all expenses. Users can filter this list by date range and category. A collapsible expander for each expense allows for in-line updates and deletions.

Reports:

Weekly & Monthly Summaries: Displays expenses in tabular form for selected weeks and months.

Visualizations: Interactive bar charts and pie charts using plotly show top spending categories and the overall distribution of expenses.

Admin Interface (Admin Role)
Administrators have access to a different set of tools from the sidebar.

Category Management: A dedicated page to create, update, and delete expense categories. This ensures data consistency across the application.

Admin Panel: Provides an overview of all users in the system. Admins can view user details, change a user's role (e.g., promote a user to admin), or delete a user and all of their associated data.

How to Run the Application
Backend Setup:

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and MongoDB installed and running.

Install the required Python packages: pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" python-jose[cryptography] "passlib[bcrypt]" pymongo.

Set your environment variables: export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key" and export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017".

Start the backend server: uvicorn main:app --reload.

Frontend Setup:

Install the required Python packages: pip install streamlit requests pandas plotly.

Set the API_BASE_URL in main.py if your backend is running on a different address.

Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run main.py.
